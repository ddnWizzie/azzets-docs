***
Create Azzets-Use (can only from your Provider)

Before creating the Assets, we must create an Assets User, who is going to use the Assets that we will create later, for them we go to the `Entities / Assets User` tab:

{% include image.html file="azzets/CreateProviAzzetsUse/entitiesAzzUse.png" alt="Create User" %}  

***
We click on the blue `Create A New Azzets Use` button and fill in the fields of the Form:  

{% include image.html file="azzets/CreateProviAzzetsUse/formPUseAzz.png" alt="Create User" %}


*Identifier*: This is the name of the Azzets Use.  

*Description*: A brief description of the Azzets use.  
* * *


At the end we must click on the blue `SAVE` button, and this will take us to the window where all the Assets Use created will be, the application gives us the option to delete or modify an Assets Use if we wish:  

{% include image.html file="azzets/CreateProviAzzetsUse/endPUseAzz.png" alt="Create User" %}
