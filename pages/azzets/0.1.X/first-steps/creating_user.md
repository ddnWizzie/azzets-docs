The first time the user starts the application, a root user must be created, for this, he only has to click on the button
 `Create a New User` 

{% include image.html file="azzets/user/button_CNUser.png" alt="Create User" %}

Then we fill in the form that appears:

{% include image.html file="azzets/user/user_register.png" alt="User Register" %}

Username:
        This is the username with which we will later access this application. In this case we will put a valid email address.

Password:
        We introduce a password (if it is secure, better) to be able to access the application. The password security level is displayed below.

Confirm Password:
        It is the confirmation of the previous field "Password". We re-enter our password to avoid mistakes.

To finish with the registration we press the blue button `Register`, which will take us to a new window, it tells us that we must go to our email and confirm our registration.

{% include image.html file="azzets/user/noReplay-check.png" alt="Email Confirmation" %}

Once this is done, the new user will be created in our database and will have access to use the application. Clicking on the link in the email will take you directly to the application confirmation window, where you will only have to log in and we are ready to use Azzets !!!

{% include image.html file="azzets/user/activation_Ok.png" alt="Sing In" %}

We click on Sing In and enter the data again, then we click on the blue Sing In button

{% include image.html file="azzets/user/sing_In.png" alt="Sing In" %}
