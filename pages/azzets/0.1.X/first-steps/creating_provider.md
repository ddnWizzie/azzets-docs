Once the user's data is updated, we must create a new provider, for this we go to the `Entities / Provider` tab:
 

{% include image.html file="azzets/crateRootProv/enntitiesProvider.png" alt="Create User" %}

* * *
We click on the blue `Create A New Provider` button and fill in the fields of the Form:

{% include image.html file="azzets/crateRootProv/formProvider.png" alt="Create User" %}  


*Identifier*: This is the name of the provider we are creating.  

*Description*: A brief description of the provider  

*Topic*: This is the name of the topic to which you are going to subscribe  

*Wizzie Organization*: Wizzie Organization to which you are sending the data. In this case there are three organizations available (FIRA, ITNOW, UCLM), the user must choose one.

* * * 

At the end we must click on the blue SAVE button, and this will take us to the window where all the providers created will be, the application gives us the option to delete or modify a provider if we wish:

   {% include image.html file="azzets/crateRootProv/providerEnd.png" alt="Create User" %}
